# CodeLouisville_Python

This project uses the Django web framework for Python to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app for checklist to do items. 
A checklist "to do" item includes a Title (required), Start Date, End Date, Description, Category (required), and Completion Status. The checklist items can be filtered for the text contained (in the title and description fields), dates (end date and start date), as well as completion status and category.

Download the project files and open through a python virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Once the virtual environment is activated from the console, use the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt (to install necessary packages, etc.)
python manage.py runserver (to run the project)
